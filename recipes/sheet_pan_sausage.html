        <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>PREP VEGGIES: It is important to prep the veggies according to directions to ensure 
                    they all cook at the same rate. Wash and chop the unpeeled baby red potatoes. You want 
                    the pieces quite small. I halve the baby potatoes and then dice each half. This yields a 
                    total of 10-12 pieces per potato. Trim the green beans and then cut in half, chop the 
                    broccoli into florets, chop the peppers into 1-inch pieces, and coin the sausage in thick 
                    (1/2-inch) slices.</li>
                <li>OLIVE OIL AND SEASONINGS: Place all the veggies and sausage on the prepared sheet pan. Pour 
                    the olive oil and all the seasonings on top. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I add 1/2 
                    teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to start with). Use your hands to toss and evenly coat 
                    all the veggies and sausage with seasonings. Space everything out so it has plenty of space to 
                    cook. If veggies are crammed/overlapping they'll steam instead of roast and will take longer to cook.</li>
                <li>BAKE: Bake 15 minutes, remove from the oven and flip/stir all the veggies around. Return to the 
                    oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender.</li>
                <li>ENJOY: If desired, sprinkle freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the veggies and sausage as soon as they 
                    come out of the oven. (If you aren't adding the cheese, you'll likely need to add some more salt to the dish.) 
                    Add fresh parsley if desired and enjoy immediately. Serve over cooked rice or quinoa if desired.</li>
            </ol>
